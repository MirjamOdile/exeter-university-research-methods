# Research methods at the University of Exeter

This repository makes available the code for a graphical exploration of the research methods used at the [University of Exeter](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/).

The provided code scrapes all abstracts from the [Open Research Exeter Database](https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/) and matches any research methods mentioned within.
These research methods are then visually explored with [wordclouds](https://amueller.github.io/word_cloud/), looking both at the **most mentioned** methods and the **key methods** for a specific subset (department, timespan).


:sparkles: Thanks to the [Exeter University Q-Step Centre](http://socialsciences.exeter.ac.uk/q-step/) for making this project possible. :sparkles:
